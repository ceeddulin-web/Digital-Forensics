Digital Forensics Investigation – A case study analyzing forensic images using Autopsy, Sleuth Kit, and Hexed.it to uncover hidden files, detect steganography, and identify corporate policy violations. Includes methodology, analysis notes, scripts, and screenshots (no raw images).

Overview

This repository showcases a digital forensics case studies completed for IA427 & IA428 Digital Forensics I & II at Eastern Michigan University. The investigations focused on forensic imaging and analysis of a suspect’s USB drive and workstation. Using tools such as Autopsy, Sleuth Kit, and Hexed.it, I identified hidden files, recovered suspicious artifacts and evaluated corporate policy violations.

Raw forensic images are excluded for confidentiality and size reasons—this repo instead highlights my workflow, scripts, and findings.
